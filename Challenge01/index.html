          As the name says, the purpose of
          Learn-a-bit is about learning one bit
          of code at a time. In these events,
          you will build small projects to
          educate yourself on the fundamentals
          of web development using HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript. These events are
          relaxed and non-competitive, but are
          still chalennging enough to push you
          to use all your resources and
          knowledge to solve each problem.
